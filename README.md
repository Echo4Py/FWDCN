Learning Flask Web Development and Translating it in Chinese.
An record the process of my FWD journey. The office branch is what I've done at my office. I translate the FWD book in Chinese that when I read it can help me to study well, cause I come from China, Chinese language is my familiar language. Although I can understand well by reading English version of this book, but translating is better helpful for understanding well, even I meet some new words that I should look up the dictionary. Maybe my translating can help someone like my son some day.
